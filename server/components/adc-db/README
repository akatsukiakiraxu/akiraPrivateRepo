PetaLinux User Application Template
===================================

This directory contains a PetaLinux user application created from a template.

You can easily import any already built application or script by copying
it into this directory, and editing the automatically generated Makefile 
as described below.

Modify the "install:" target in Makefile to use $(TARGETINST) to install your
prebuilt application or script to the host copy of the target file system
referring to the comments of the "install:" target.

Before building the application, you will need to enable the application
from PetaLinux menuconfig by running:
    "petalinux-config -c rootfs"
You will see your application in the "Applications --->" submenu.

To install your prebuilt application or script to the target file system
copy on the host, simply run the 
    "petalinux-build -c rootfs/adc-dma"
command.

You will also need to rebuild PetaLinux bootable images so that the images
is updated with the updated target filesystem copy, run this command:
    "petalinux-build -x package"

You can also run one PetaLinux command to install the application to the
target filesystem host copy and update the bootable images as follows:
    "petalinux-build"
